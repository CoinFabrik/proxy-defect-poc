# Old PoC

This PoC is based on a much older version of the proxy contract and all implementation details were flattened to a single contract to ease reading it.
In essence, the proxy functionality is the same. It's just more of a "monolithic" implementation. I didn't check what differences there are with v2.5.2, if any.
